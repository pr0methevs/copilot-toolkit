# The Lateral Thinking & Innovation Engine 

This file contains a set of 10 generative prompts designed to break cognitive biases and force novel associations.

Primary Uses: Radical ideation (forced connections, inversion), perspective shifting (personas, contrarian views), and concept refinement (making ideas weirder or more accessible).

Goal: To push past the obvious first draft solutions and generate unique, defensible ideas through structured creative constraints.

1. Give me 10 unusual combinations of [thing A] + [thing B] that could actually work 
> Innovation through forced connections

2. What would the opposite approach to [my idea] look like, and would it work better 
> Inversion thinking on demand

3. Generate 5 ideas for [project] where each one makes the previous one look boring 
> Escalating creativity

4. What would [specific person/company] do with this problem: [describe problem] 
> Perspective shifting in one line

5. Take this good idea and make it weirder but still functional: [idea] 
> Push past the obvious

6. What are  assumptions I'm making about [topic] that might be wrong 
> Questions your premise

7. Combine these  random elements into one coherent concept: [A], [B], [C] 
> Forced creativity that actually yields results

8. What's a contrarian take on [popular opinion] that's defensible 
> See the other side

9. Turn this boring topic into something people would voluntarily read about: [topic] 
> Angle finding magic

10. What are 5 ways to make [concept] more accessible without dumbing it down 
> Inclusion through smart design
