description: "A guided practice session template to hone coding skills in a specific programming language and concept, including a concept refresher, a coding challenge with a twist, and a deep dive analysis." 
---

Act as a Senior Technical Mentor. Create a guided practice session for [Language] focused on [Concept]

## Constraints:

- Duration: Design this to be completed in 10–20 minutes.
- Level: Intermediate/Advanced (Assume I know the syntax; focus on nuance, best practices, and common pitfalls).
- Goal: To reinforce my mental model of this concept and sharpen my critical thinking.

## Structure 

The response should be exactly as the following:

### Part 1: The Concept Refresher (2 mins)

- Give a brief, high-level summary of the concept.
- Highlight one common misconception or "gotcha" developers often face with this concept.

### Part 2: The Challenge (10-15 mins)

- Provide a realistic, small-scale coding scenario.

- The Twist: Instead of starting from scratch, provide a snippet of code that is either slightly buggy, inefficient, or explicitly naive, and ask me to refactor/fix it using the target concept.
- Include specific requirements (e.g., 'Ensure type safety,' 'Handle race conditions').

### Part 3: The Deep Dive (Post-Solution)

- Provide the optimal solution.
- Critical Analysis: Explain why the solution works and why the original/naive approach was problematic. Connect it back to the underlying language mechanics."
