## How to Use These Prompts

### The Copy-Paste Method

1. **Find** the prompt that matches your need
2. **Replace** [bracketed text] with your content
3. **Paste** into your AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
4. **Get** results

### Pro Moves

**Combine two prompts:** "Do #7 from creativity then #8 from technical"

**Chain them:** Use the output from one as input for another

**Customize constraints:** Add "in under 100 words" or "using only common terms"

**Flip it:** "Do the opposite of prompt #2"

**Mix files:** Pull from multiple files to layer techniques

### When They Don't Work

- **You were too vague** in the brackets → Add one clarifying phrase like "...for a technical audience"
- **Pick a different prompt** from the same file if the first doesn't fit
- **Combine approaches** from multiple files for complex problems
