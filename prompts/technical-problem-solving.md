# The Technical Logic & Systems Toolkit 

This file contains a set of 10 analytical prompts designed to stress test solutions and uncover blind spots in your reasoning.

Primary Uses: Root cause analysis (identifying meta problems), strategic foresight (second order consequences, pre mortems), and decision engineering (matrixes, MVPs, and reverse engineering).

Goal: To move beyond surface level fixes and apply rigorous structural thinking to ensure you are solving the right problems efficiently.

1. Debug my thinking: here's my problem and my solution attempt, what am I missing: [describe both] 
> Rubber duck debugging, upgraded

3. What are the second order consequences of [decision] that I'm not seeing 
> Think three steps ahead

4. Give me the pros, cons, and the one thing nobody talks about for: [option] 
> That third category is gold

5. What would have to be true for [unlikely thing] to work 
> Working backwards from outcomes

6. Turn this error message into plain English and tell me what to actually do: [paste error] 
> Tech translation service

7. What's the simplest possible version of [complex solution] that would solve 80% of the problem 
> Minimum viable everything

8. Give me a decision matrix for [choice] with non-obvious criteria 
> Better than pros/cons lists

9. What are  ways this could fail that look like success at first: [plan] 
> Failure mode analysis

10. Reverse engineer this outcome: [desired result]—what had to happen to get here 
> Working backwards is underrated

11. What's the meta-problem behind this problem: [describe issue] 
> Solves the root, not the symptom
