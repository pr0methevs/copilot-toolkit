# The Corporate Strategy & Productivity Toolkit 

This file contains a set of 10 tactical prompts designed to cut through inertia and navigate workplace dynamics.

Primary Uses: Instant task breakdown (overcoming procrastination), strategic communication (saying "no," de-escalating conflict), and high-leverage planning (agendas, critical paths, and risk assessment).

Goal: To turn vague requirements into actionable steps and manage professional relationships without sacrificing your time or sanity.
