## Why These Work:

These prompts are designed to make Perplexity do what it does best – synthesize information from multiple sources and find connections you might miss. They’re also specific enough to get useful results but flexible enough to adapt to different topics.

The key is that each prompt asks Perplexity to perform a specific type of thinking:

- **Analysis**: Breaking down complex information
- **Synthesis**: Connecting disparate pieces
- **Evaluation**: Judging quality and importance
- **Creativity**: Finding new approaches
- **Strategy**: Planning for the future

## How to Use These Effectively:

1. **Customize the brackets**: Replace [bracketed terms] with your specific situation
2. **Layer the prompts**: Use multiple prompts on the same topic for deeper insight
3. **Follow up**: Ask “What else should I consider?” to dig deeper
4. **Verify critical information**: Double-check important facts and assumptions
5. **Adapt to your needs**: Modify the language and focus for your specific use case
